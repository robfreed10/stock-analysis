# stock-analysis
using VBA to uncover trends in the dataset
# Overview
Steve had asked for analysis of different energy stocks on Excel using VBA, also known as Visual Basic Applications. In the beginning of my analysis, I had written code to just analyze the stocks total return and daily volume for 2018 as well as how fast that code was executed. This updated analysis is refractored code, which is different from my original code to also find the total return and daily volume for these stocks in 2017 as well as how fast the code was executed. I was really satisfied with the accuracy of my code as well as the codes execution time for both 2017 and 2018. Below, I will be speaking about how the stocks differed in 2017 and 2018. 
# Results
## 2017
2017 was a successful year for the energy stocks assigned to me for analysis by Steve. Every stock except for TERP which had a return of -7.2%, had a positive return for the year. The stock that performed the greatest based on its return was DQ, which had a 199% return. The analysis of the 12 stocks in 2017 will be showed here. ![2017 Analysis](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68922663/95026570-2f973d80-0660-11eb-80d9-69a43af9b4f6.png) 
When Steve opens this document, he will be able to execute the code for 2017 quite fast. He can press the button "Run Analysis For All" and a window will pop up asking him what year he would like to use to analyze the stocks. An example of how long the user can expect for the code to run will be shown here. ![VBA_Challenge_2017](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68922663/95026603-8866d600-0660-11eb-8c65-717096d9d4d1.png) Steve does not have to write any code of his own, and with the press of the button, he will have clear analysis of which stocks performed well, and which ones did not. 
## 2018
2018 however, was not a successful year for the energy stocks that was also analyzed for Steve. Only ENPH (81.9%) and RUN (84%) had positive returns, quite different from 2017. Surprisingly, the worst performing stock was DQ in 2018, bringing about a return of -62.6%. It is quite interesting how drastically the stock DQ changed over the two years, but bringing this to Steve's attention will be important in the stock analysis. The analysis of the 12 stocks in 2018 will be shown here. ![2018 Analysis](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68922663/95026725-6752b500-0661-11eb-9353-e8ee19c0f0a2.png)
Like in 2017, Steve will be able to see how fast this code is running to bring him the data on the 12 stocks in 2018. Allowing quick and efficient results will allow Steve to analyze these stocks smoothly. An example of how long the user can expect for the code to run can be shown here. ![VBA_Challenge_2018](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68922663/95026758-a6810600-0661-11eb-9d18-cd519ea254b5.png)
# Summary
### Advantages of Refractoring
The advantages for refractoring this code were abundantly clear as the new code was cleaned up and more readable then compared to my first code. This allowed for the code to run much more smoother and more faster than my initial code. 
### Disadvantage of Refractoring
The disadvantages for refractoring this code was that at first, the new refractored code was not working like the initial code I had created. 
### Advantage of Refractoring this VBA Code
The advantage for this refractored code is that the user knows how fast the code is being executed and how successful the code is. To see the code run faster and faster as I continued refractoring was a major accomplishment of mine during the programming of the code. 
### Disadvantage of Refractoring this VBA Code
The disadvantage of refractoring this VBA code was the frustration that ensued when the code would not work. Before the code would finally run, the only reason it was not running was because of how the code was written in the Visual Basic Editor. One indent to certain lines of code made the program run quite efficiently, at the expense of my frustration. Overall though, I am very proud of my work and refractoring this code for Steve's analysis of these stocks
